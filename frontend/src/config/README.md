# Amplify Configuration Guide

This directory contains the AWS Amplify configuration for the frontend application.

## Configuration File

`amplify.ts` - Main Amplify configuration with Cognito Auth and API Gateway settings.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy Backend Infrastructure

First, deploy the backend SAM template to get the required values:

```bash
cd backend
sam build
sam deploy --guided
```

Save the stack outputs from the deployment. You'll need:
- `UserPoolId`
- `UserPoolClientId`
- `UserPoolDomain`
- `ApiUrl`
- `FrontendUrl` (CloudFront distribution URL)

### 2. Update Configuration

You have two options for configuring the frontend:

#### Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:

```env
VITE_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_ABC123XYZ
VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID=1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m
VITE_USER_POOL_DOMAIN=my-app-domain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com
VITE_API_URL=https://abc123xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=https://d123abc456xyz.cloudfront.net
VITE_AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### Option B: Direct Configuration

Edit `amplify.ts` and replace the placeholder values:

```typescript
userPoolId: 'us-east-1_ABC123XYZ',
userPoolClientId: '1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m',
domain: 'my-app-domain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com',
endpoint: 'https://abc123xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
```

### 3. Update OAuth Redirect URLs

After deploying the frontend to CloudFront, you need to update the Cognito User Pool Client with the actual redirect URLs:

1. Go to AWS Cognito Console
2. Select your User Pool
3. Go to "App integration" → "App clients"
4. Edit your app client
5. Update "Allowed callback URLs" to include your CloudFront URL:
   - `https://d123abc456xyz.cloudfront.net`
6. Update "Allowed sign-out URLs" to include your CloudFront URL:
   - `https://d123abc456xyz.cloudfront.net`
7. Save changes

### 4. Local Development

For local development, the configuration defaults to `http://localhost:5173` for OAuth redirects.

Make sure your Cognito User Pool Client includes `http://localhost:5173` in:
- Allowed callback URLs
- Allowed sign-out URLs

### 5. Verify Configuration

After configuration, test the setup:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and try signing in. You should be redirected to the Cognito Hosted UI.

## Configuration Reference

### Auth Configuration

- `userPoolId`: The Cognito User Pool ID from SAM output
- `userPoolClientId`: The Cognito User Pool Client ID from SAM output
- `domain`: The Cognito hosted UI domain (without https://)
- `scopes`: OAuth scopes requested (openid, email, profile)
- `redirectSignIn`: URLs to redirect to after successful sign-in
- `redirectSignOut`: URLs to redirect to after sign-out
- `responseType`: OAuth response type (code for authorization code flow)

### API Configuration

- `endpoint`: The API Gateway endpoint URL from SAM output
- `region`: AWS region where resources are deployed

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid redirect_uri" Error

This means the redirect URL in your app doesn't match what's configured in Cognito.

**Solution**: Update the Cognito User Pool Client's allowed callback URLs to include your frontend URL.

### "User pool client does not exist" Error

This means the `userPoolClientId` is incorrect.

**Solution**: Verify the client ID from SAM outputs or Cognito console.

### API Calls Failing with CORS Errors

This means the API Gateway CORS configuration doesn't allow your frontend domain.

**Solution**: Update the SAM template's CORS configuration to include your CloudFront URL.

### Environment Variables Not Loading

Vite requires environment variables to be prefixed with `VITE_`.

**Solution**: Ensure all variables in `.env` start with `VITE_` and restart the dev server.

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files with real credentials to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Rotate credentials if accidentally exposed
