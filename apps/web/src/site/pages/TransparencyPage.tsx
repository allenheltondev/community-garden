          Olivia&apos;s Garden Foundation was founded in {foundedYear} and received IRS
          501(c)(3) recognition on {irsDeterminationDate}. Because we are a new
          organization, we do not yet have a published annual report or a filed IRS Form
          990. Our first IRS filing, covering our initial reporting period, will be made
          in 2026, and a summary will be posted on this page once filed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We operate at a small scale, well below the IRS thresholds for a full Form 990,
          and we expect to file Form 990-N (e-Postcard) for our first reporting period.
          Once our annual receipts grow past those thresholds, we will move to Form 990-EZ
          or full Form 990 as required.
        </p>

          In plain language, the money that comes in is used for:

        <ul className="site-list">
          <li>Seeds, plants, soil, and garden materials</li>
          <li>Lumber, fencing, and hardware for raised beds, animal enclosures, and on-site infrastructure</li>
          <li>Feed, bedding, and veterinary care for chickens, turkeys, geese, goats, bees, and guineas</li>
          <li>Supplies and materials for workshops</li>
          <li>Shipping costs for the free okra seed program</li>
          <li>Software, hosting, and operational costs for the Good Roots Network platform and the foundation website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We have no paid staff, no office lease, and no fundraising contractors. The
          founders cover incidental overhead personally rather than from donated funds
          where practical.
